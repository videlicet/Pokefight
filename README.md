# Pokéfight-Frontend

A small SPA for Pokébouts.

## Acknowledgements

Frontend built with:
* JavaScript, React.js, HTML5, CSS3

## How to Run

Replace the default export in `URL_SERVER_DOMAIN` with the domain of your server.

In case you deploy on Netlify, copy the `_redirects` file in the root folder to your build folder. This will prevent refreshing the deployed page from throwing a 404.
